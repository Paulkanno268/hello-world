My first repository

Hello Github community!!!

  My name is Paul Kanno and I am an aspiring Ruby on Rails developer! I am on a journey to land a position as a junior developer within a 9 month time period by March 2017. I like to hike, go camping, learn new things, love my coffee, and am really enjoying the learning process of becoming a programmer! :) I am looking forward to working with my fellow developers here on Github and hope to contribute to the Github community with some really awesome, creative and innovative projects.
